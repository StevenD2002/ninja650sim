# Welcome to my simulator!

This is a ecu + engine simluator built in go. It uses simple physics formulas to simulate
various aspecs of an ecu and an engine, along with wheel rotation and speed.

This simulator uses grpc streaming to stream data between the terminal client and the server, and uses websockets to stream data to the web ui built in react.
